# TurboJet-Simulator

This class is designed to calculate **the fundamental performance parameters of a turbojet engine**. The simulator is **particularly useful for engineering applications, academic projects, or conceptual studies involving air-breathing jet engines**. It calculates a range of outputs based on a set of core inputs typically available in turbomachinery design and analysis. 

**Key features:**
**Computation of Core Parameters:**
- Thrust (in Newtons);
- Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption TSFC (in kg/Nh);
- Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR);
- Temperature ratio between critical sections (TT4/TT2);
**Input parameters include:**
- Ambient pressure and temperature;
- Compression ratio;
- Combustion chamber exit temperature (TT4) or exit turbine temperature (EGT);
- Other relevant cycle-specific values such as the efficiency of compressor, of the air inlet and polytropic efficiencies.
**Graphical Output:**
- It generates at the end a Total Pressure vs Total Temperature plot to visualize the thermodynamic process across all the jet engine.
